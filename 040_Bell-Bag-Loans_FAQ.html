                <h3>Q: Why are you calling me?</h3>
                <p>A: If we have an account with your name, we are calling to verify your identity and collect the debt.</p>
                <p>If you are a debt seller, we are calling to purchase portfolios from you.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Q: How do I know you are a legitimate company?</h3>

                <h3>Q: What if I don't have access to Zelle?</h3>
                <p>We can walk you through opening an account and setting up payments that does use Zelle.</p>
                <p>If not, that's okay. We accept other forms of payment.</p>
                <p>Venmo, CashApp, PayPal, Checks, MoneyOrders, and Cash</p>
                <p>If you have another preferred method, feel free to ask about it.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>Q: Can I pay with a credit card?</h3>
                <p>We do not accept credit cards. The goal is to get you out of debt, not to move it somewhere else.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Q: Why don't you just forgive my debt?</h3>
                <p>We can do that, but there are two reasons we don't.</p>
                <p>1) You will have to pay taxes on any amount that is forgiven.</p>
                <p>2) Your payments finance debt relief for others.</p>
