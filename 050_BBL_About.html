            <p>
                Freedom is my highest value. <br>
                Debt is my tightest shackle. <br>
                Freedom of education got me a Bachelors of Science in Mechanical Engineering from The Ohio State University.<br>
                Debt got me  <em>$300,000</em> in student loans.<br>
                I know the pain and stress that comes from being loaded with debt.<br>
                <b>That's why my mission is to eliminate that pain and stress for the people of California.</b>
            </p>

            <p>
                I've read books and papers, done the research, filed forms, drafted contracts, gathered funds, built a website, and much more.<br>
                I've jumped through many hoops to get here, but all of that effort means nothing without you.<br>
                I need your help<br>
                Together, we can eliminate debt.
            </p>

            <p>
                I was inspired to start Bell Bag Loans by <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Nook">a certain raccoon</a></em> who issues loans with no interest and no time limit on repayment.<br>
                I believe the people of Califronia are responsible enough to handle this freedom, if they are given the chance.<br>
                With your help, we can give the people of California that chance by freeing them from debt<br>
                We can build a world with happier people and a stonger economy.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm based out of the Los Angeles South Bay Area, and every day is filled to the brim.<br>
                During the day, I work full time in software quality assurance.
                During the evening, I work on Bell Bag Loans.
                During the night, I write essays, stories, poetry, and music.
                My essays on debt and finance can be found in the blog section of the Bell Bag Loans website.
                My other creative work can be found elsewhere online, but I'll never tell where.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thank you for showing interest in Bell Bag Loans.<br>
                I look forward to speaking with you in the near future.<br>
                With your help, we'll polish the stain of debt from the golden state.
